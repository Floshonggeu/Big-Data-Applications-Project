# Big-Data-Applications-Project

Big Data Applications Project 2021

Group Members:

- Florian SHONG GEU

## Introduction

The first step of the project is to create three classification machine learning models, using three different methods:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Gradient Boosting

However, the goal of this project isn't just to create three machine learning models. Indeed, these models' accuracies aren't very important, because the real goal is to implement
multiple tools into the project, in order to make the project more understandable for everyone.
The tools to be used are:
- Git
- Conda environment
- Mlflow
- SHAP
